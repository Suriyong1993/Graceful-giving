# Production Engineering Audit

**Repository:** `Suriyong1993/Graceful-giving`
**Branch:** `main`
**Baseline commit:** `8f1f400` (`fix: clarify finance UX and protect form data`)
**Audit mode:** Gate-by-gate; no feature is marked PASS from UI presence alone.

## Gate 0 — Repository and Baseline

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Repository located | PASS | Cloned `Suriyong1993/Graceful-giving` at `/home/ubuntu/Graceful-giving`. |
| Working tree before audit | PASS | `git status --short --branch` reported `## main...origin/main`. |
| Existing commit reviewed | PASS | `git show --stat 8f1f400` reviewed; commit changes six client files. |
| TypeScript check | PASS | `pnpm check` completed with exit code 0. |
| Automated tests | PASS | `pnpm test`: 3 test files, 7 tests passed. |
| Production build | PASS | `pnpm build` completed; Vite, server bundle, and API bundle built. |
| Generated build artifacts | PASS | Generated `api/index.js` was restored; working tree returned clean. |

## Gate 1 — Production Readiness and Data/Security Baseline

| Area | Status | Evidence / reason |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment status | NOT VERIFIED | Repository contains `vercel.json`, but no production URL or deployment evidence is present in the repository. Vercel connector is enabled; deployment inspection is pending external tool verification. |
| Production environment | NOT VERIFIED | No repository `.env*` file was present. Runtime environment values were not exposed or inferred. |
| Database migration inventory | FAIL | Repository migrations contain `users`, `church_profiles`, `members`, `notifications`, `audit_logs`, `finance_accounts`, `offerings`, `expenses`, `withdrawal_requests`, `budget_plans`, `church_news`, and `church_events`; the prompt's required entities such as `transactions`, `transaction_splits`, `fund_transfers`, `member_giving_records`, `action_confirmations`, and `auth_pins` are absent from the repository schema/migrations. |
| RLS policies | NOT VERIFIED | No Supabase RLS/policy SQL was found in repository migrations. Production database policy state requires direct inspection. |
| Financial hard-delete protection | FAIL | `server/db.ts` contains `deleteOffering` and `deleteExpense` using SQL `DELETE`; routers expose these operations under `offerings.delete` and `expenses.delete`, despite the financial void requirement. |
| Atomic financial mutation | FAIL | Create/update/void flows update the record and fund balance in separate statements without an explicit transaction. |
| Fund requirement | FAIL | `fundId` is optional in schema, router validation, and create flows for offerings/expenses; the prompt requires fund selection when business rules require it. |
| API authorization baseline | PARTIAL | tRPC has `protectedProcedure`, `adminProcedure`, and finance-role middleware, but member mutations use `protectedProcedure`; database/RLS enforcement is not established. |
| Audit trail | PARTIAL | Financial create/update/void routers call `createAuditLog`, but audit records lack before/after fields and direct database immutability/RLS is unverified. |
| Mock/fake data scan | PARTIAL | No production `mock*` dataset was accepted as evidence; UI includes preview/session-storage helpers and component showcase code that require environment/path review. |

## Gate Decision

**Gate 0: PASS.** Baseline tooling and repository evidence are reproducible.
**Gate 1: BLOCKED / NOT READY.** Production deployment, production database, and RLS cannot be declared verified from repository evidence alone; additional P0 financial defects are already confirmed by source inspection.

## Next Gate

Before changing behavior, reproduce and test the confirmed P0 defects, then apply small fixes with database-safe transactions, void-only financial mutation semantics, explicit validation, and regression coverage. Do not claim Production Ready until production deployment, database schema, RLS, and critical journeys are directly verified.

## Gate 2 — P0 Financial Hardening

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Financial hard-delete path removed | PASS | Source search returned no `delete(offerings)`, `delete(expenses)`, or `DELETE FROM offerings/expenses`; legacy helpers now delegate to `voidOffering`/`voidExpense`. |
| Offering create atomicity | PASS | `createOffering` uses `db.transaction`; insert and fund balance increment use the same transaction handle. |
| Offering update atomicity | PASS | `updateOffering` uses `db.transaction`; record update and old/new fund adjustments share one transaction. |
| Expense create atomicity | PASS | `createExpense` uses `db.transaction`; insert and fund balance decrement share one transaction. |
| Expense update atomicity | PASS | `updateExpense` uses `db.transaction`; record update and old/new fund adjustments share one transaction. |
| Offering void atomicity | PASS | `voidOffering` uses `db.transaction`; status change and fund reversal share one transaction. Repeated void remains rejected by existing status guard. |
| Expense void atomicity | PASS | `voidExpense` uses `db.transaction`; status change and fund reversal share one transaction. Repeated void remains rejected by existing status guard. |
| TypeScript regression | PASS | `pnpm check` completed with exit code 0 after the change. |
| Automated regression | PASS | `pnpm test`: 3 test files, 7 tests passed after the change. |
| Production build regression | PASS | `pnpm build` completed after the change; generated `api/index.js` was restored afterward. |
| Diff hygiene | PASS | `git diff --check` completed without whitespace errors. |

## Updated Gate Decision

**Gate 2 P0 hardening: PASS for the implemented source-level controls.**
This does not prove database execution, RLS, concurrency behavior against a live database, or production behavior. Those remain NOT VERIFIED/BLOCKED because no Supabase project or Vercel project was available through the enabled connectors.

## Gate 1 v2 — Production Evidence and Domain Applicability

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub → production deployment mapping | PASS | GitHub deployment `6505085026` maps exactly to commit `178ad2e7d2410ee9ac9447b0d71855d50fd78bcb`; deployment environment is `Production`, status is `success`, and Vercel target is `https://graceful-giving-2fphn2puk-tlcs-projects-ab505ecc.vercel.app`. |
| Vercel commit status | PASS | GitHub commit status for `178ad2e` is `success`; context `Vercel`; deployment completed. |
| Production branch alignment | PASS | `origin/main` and local `HEAD` both point to `178ad2e`; deployment ref points to the same SHA. |
| Anonymous production smoke test | NOT VERIFIED | Root and `/api/health` return Vercel SSO redirect, so application HTML/API behavior cannot be inspected without an authorized browser session. |
| Production environment values | NOT VERIFIED | GitHub environment names `Preview` and `Production` exist; secret values were not read. Vercel runtime environment values remain unverified. |
| Supabase project/database | NOT VERIFIED | Enabled Supabase connector returned no projects; no live database truth was available in this session. |
| Candidate `transactions` | NOT APPLICABLE | No product, server, schema, migration, or workflow reference found outside audit documents. |
| Candidate `transaction_splits` | NOT APPLICABLE | No product, server, schema, migration, or workflow reference found outside audit documents. |
| Candidate `fund_transfers` | NOT APPLICABLE | No product, server, schema, migration, or workflow reference found outside audit documents. |
| Candidate `member_giving_records` | NOT APPLICABLE | No product, server, schema, migration, or workflow reference found outside audit documents. |
| Candidate `action_confirmations` | NOT APPLICABLE | No product, server, schema, migration, or workflow reference found outside audit documents. |
| Candidate `auth_pins` | NOT APPLICABLE | No product, server, schema, migration, or workflow reference found outside audit documents. |

## Updated Gate Decision

**Gate 1 v2 deployment mapping: PASS.**
**Gate 1 v2 runtime/database truth: NOT VERIFIED.** SSO prevents anonymous application smoke testing, and no Supabase project is available through the enabled connector. Candidate entities with no product evidence are explicitly **NOT APPLICABLE**; no schema was invented.
