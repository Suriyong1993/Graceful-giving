# Final Engineering Verification

**Repository:** `Suriyong1993/Graceful-giving`
**Branch:** `main`
**Audited baseline:** `8f1f400`
**Status:** **NOT READY** — production readiness cannot be declared while required database, RLS, deployment, and critical journey evidence is unavailable or incomplete.

| Area | Status | Evidence | Remaining Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build | PASS | `pnpm build` passed before and after P0 hardening. | Large chunks remain; optimization is P2. |
| Deployment | NOT VERIFIED | Vercel connector is enabled, but `list_projects` returned no projects. | No production URL/status/smoke evidence. |
| Database | NOT VERIFIED | Supabase connector is enabled, but `list_projects` returned no projects. | Live schema and runtime behavior unavailable. |
| Migration | FAIL | Repository has two Drizzle SQL migrations, but required prompt entities (`transactions`, `transaction_splits`, `fund_transfers`, `member_giving_records`, `action_confirmations`, `auth_pins`) are absent. | Domain coverage and migration completeness are unresolved. |
| Auth | PARTIAL | `protectedProcedure` and auth tests exist; `pnpm test` passed. | Session expiry and production login not verified. |
| RLS | NOT VERIFIED | No RLS policy SQL exists in repository migrations; no Supabase project available for inspection. | Database authorization may not be enforced. |
| Members CRUD | PARTIAL | Router and database functions exist; no full persistence/E2E verification. | Live CRUD and role enforcement unverified. |
| Offering CRUD | PARTIAL | Router/database flow exists; financial mutations hardened with transactions and void semantics. | Live DB, validation rules, and E2E unverified. |
| Expense CRUD | PARTIAL | Router/database flow exists; financial mutations hardened with transactions and void semantics. | Live DB, validation rules, and E2E unverified. |
| Funds | FAIL | Balance is maintained by application statements; no live DB transaction/invariant test or database constraint evidence. | Concurrent updates and missing-fund behavior unresolved. |
| Void workflow | PASS (source) | Void paths preserve rows, set void status, reverse fund impact atomically, and reject repeated void. | Live DB and UI refresh journey unverified. |
| Audit Log | PARTIAL | Financial router mutations call `createAuditLog`. | Before/after fields, immutability, and live audit persistence unverified. |
| Notifications | PARTIAL | Persistent notification functions and access tests exist. | Production creation/read/unread journey unverified. |
| Forms | PARTIAL | Existing commit added form protection in several financial pages. | Complete route-by-route coverage unverified. |
| UX | PARTIAL | Existing source has loading/empty/error components in inspected paths. | Full route and accessibility audit unverified. |
| Mobile | NOT VERIFIED | No browser/device smoke evidence collected. | Viewport behavior unverified. |
| E2E | NOT VERIFIED | No E2E suite was found; only 7 unit/access tests passed. | Critical journeys 1–6 unverified. |
| Performance | PARTIAL | Build passed; Vite reported chunks above 500 kB. | Bundle and runtime performance need measured follow-up. |

## Commands Verified

- `pnpm check` — PASS
- `pnpm test` — PASS, 3 files / 7 tests
- `pnpm build` — PASS
- `git diff --check` — PASS
- Source search for financial hard deletes — PASS after hardening

## v2 Evidence Update

| Area | Status | Evidence | Remaining Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current production deployment | PASS | Deployment `6505085026` succeeded for exact commit `178ad2e`; target URL: `https://graceful-giving-2fphn2puk-tlcs-projects-ab505ecc.vercel.app`. | Anonymous runtime smoke test is blocked by Vercel SSO. |
| GitHub/Vercel commit mapping | PASS | `origin/main`, local `HEAD`, deployment `sha`, and Vercel commit status all point to `178ad2e7d2410ee9ac9447b0d71855d50fd78bcb`. | None for mapping. |
| Anonymous production smoke | NOT VERIFIED | `/` and `/api/health` redirect to Vercel SSO. | Authorized browser session is required for application-level smoke tests. |
| Production environment | NOT VERIFIED | GitHub exposes `Preview` and `Production` environment names; values were not read. | Runtime env and database connectivity remain unknown. |
| Candidate financial tables | NOT APPLICABLE | `transactions`, `transaction_splits`, `fund_transfers`, `member_giving_records`, `action_confirmations`, and `auth_pins` have no product/code/schema/workflow references. | Do not create these tables without new product evidence. |

## Corrected Domain Interpretation

The previous migration concern treated checklist candidate entities as required schema. Under Master Engineering Prompt v2, the repository evidence shows those candidates are **NOT APPLICABLE**, not FAIL. The actual implemented domain is centered on `offerings`, `expenses`, `finance_accounts`, `withdrawal_requests`, `members`, `notifications`, and `audit_logs`.
